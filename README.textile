oh-my-zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration. It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and few things that make you shout...

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

Forked from "robbyrussel":https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

h2. Setup

@oh-my-zsh@ should work with any recent release of "zsh":http://www.zsh.org/, the minimum recommended version is 4.3.9.

1. Clone the repository

  @git clone git://github.com/kevinnguy/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh@

2. *OPTIONAL* Backup your existing ~/.zshrc file

  @cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig@

3. Create a new zsh config by copying the zsh template we've provided.

  @cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc@

4. Set zsh as your default shell:

  @chsh -s /bin/zsh@

5. Start / restart zsh (open a new terminal is easy enough...)

6. Upgrade oh my zsh for the latest updates: @upgrade_oh_my_zsh@

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your PATH in ~/.zshrc if you're not able to find some commands after switching to _Oh My Zsh_.

If you installed manually or changed the install location, check ZSH in ~/.zshrc

h2. Usage

* enable the plugins you want in your @~/.zshrc@ (take a look at the @plugins/@ directory and the "wiki":https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins to see what's possible)
** example: @plugins=(git osx ruby)@
* much much more...  take a look at @lib/@ what _Oh My Zsh_ offers...

h2. Useful

the "refcard":http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf is pretty tasty for tips.

h3. Customization

If you want to override any of the default behavior, just add a new file (ending in @.zsh@) into the @custom/@ directory.
If you have many functions which go well together you can put them as a *.plugin.zsh file in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and then enable this plugin.
If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with oh-my-zsh, create a plugin of the same name in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in @plugins/@.

h3. Updates

By default you will be prompted to check for updates. If you would like oh-my-zsh to automatically update itself without prompting you, set the following in your ~/.zshrc

@DISABLE_UPDATE_PROMPT=true@

To disable updates entirely, put this in your ~/.zshrc

@DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true@

To upgrade directly from the command line, just run @upgrade_oh_my_zsh@

h3. Uninstalling

If you want to uninstall it, just run @uninstall_oh_my_zsh@ from the command line and it'll remove itself and revert you to bash (or your previous zsh config).
